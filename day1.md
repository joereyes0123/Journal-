### Day 2
Today we learned to create link Git repositories, load them to our local workstations and upload changes/modifications made to them.
We also touched on day 1 JS intruction using alert and prompt methods.
### Day 3
Today we discussed different types of loops (While, Do while and for). We also touch on CSS basics which I find to be a real pain in the B. 
### Day 4
Today we leaned the “forking” technique for GitHub. We brush up on more CSS rules and learned to incorporate functions into out code.

### Day 5 
Today we touched on Git Branches and deploying final work. Out lab consisted of pre-arranged functions.

### Day 6
Today we reviewed ojects and how to embed their properties into .html files.

### Day 7 
today we discussed and used constructors to add data tables to our html file using our JS script.

###Day 8
Today we discussed how to create tables using forms.

###Day 9
Today we reviewed the constructors we created on day 8. Watching and hearing Allie breakdown each line help clear-up a ton of questions. At this point in class I find that Im having an easier time understanding what behind the code Im writing.

###Day 11
Today we tried to construct a random generator for a website. Im lost, so lost. I got the images to lead and generate but that as far as I got.
